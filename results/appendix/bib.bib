	abstract = {Analytic techniques developed for big data have much broader applications in the social sciences, outperforming standard regression models even—or rather especially—in smaller datasets. This article offers an overview of machine learning methods well-suited to social science problems, including decision trees, dimension reduction methods, nearest neighbor algorithms, support vector models, and penalized regression. In addition to novel algorithms, machine learning places great emphasis on model checking (through holdout samples and cross-validation) and model shrinkage (adjusting predictions toward the mean to reduce overfitting). This article advocates replacing typical regression analyses with two different sorts of models used in concert. A multi-algorithm ensemble approach should be used to determine the noise floor of a given dataset, while simpler methods such as penalized regression or decision trees should be used for theory building and hypothesis testing.},

	abstract = {Many social scientists believe that dumping long lists of explanatory variables into linear regression, probit, logit, and other statistical equations will successfully “control” for the effects of auxiliary factors. Encouraged by convenient software and ever more powerful computing, researchers also believe that this conventional approach gives the true explanatory variables the best chance to emerge. The present paper argues that these beliefs are false, and that without intensive data analysis, linear regression models are likely to be inaccurate. Instead, a quite different and less mechanical research methodology is needed, one that integrates contemporary powerful statistical methods with deep substantive knowledge and classic data—analytic techniques of creative engagement with the data.},
